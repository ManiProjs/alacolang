# Alaco (You can also call it A)
A programming language, just for hobby, not a big project

## How it works?
Unlike other compilers, where turn the tokens to assembly code, this compiler is going to turn the tokens to C++ code

Read the file -> Parse the token -> Convert tokens to C++ code -> Call the C++ compiler -> C++ compiler compiles it -> Now it's compiled and ready to run
